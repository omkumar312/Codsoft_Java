Number Guessing Game

This Java program implements a simple number guessing game where the computer generates a random number between 1 and 100, and the player tries to guess it within a limited number of attempts. After each guess, the program provides feedback on whether the guess was too high or too low, and informs the player of the number of attempts taken. The player can choose to play multiple rounds, and the final score is displayed after all rounds are completed.

Main Focus:

Programming Language: Java
Topics Covered:
Input handling using Scanner for user interaction.
Random number generation using Random class.
Loop structures (while loops) for game flow control.
Conditional statements (if-else) for decision-making based on user input.
String manipulation and comparison for replay option.

The game starts with a welcome message and prompts the player to guess a number. If the player guesses correctly within the allowed attempts, they earn a point. The game continues until the player chooses not to play again. The final score, indicating the number of successful guesses, is displayed at the end of the game session.

GRADE CALCULATOR

This Java program calculates the average percentage and assigns a grade based on marks entered for a specified number of subjects. It prompts the user to input marks for each subject, computes the total marks and percentage, determines the corresponding grade, and allows the user to choose whether to recalculate grades or exit.

Main Focus:

Programming Language: Java
Topics Covered:
Input handling using Scanner for user interaction.
Looping (for loop) for iterating through subjects and calculating totals.
Conditional statements (if-else) to determine grades based on percentage ranges.
Recursion (main method calling itself) for allowing recalculations based on user input.
String manipulation and comparison for user responses.

Functionality:

The program begins by asking for the number of subjects and then iterates through each subject to collect marks. After calculating the total marks and percentage, it determines the grade based on predefined percentage thresholds. It then offers the user the option to recalculate grades or exit the program based on their response.
